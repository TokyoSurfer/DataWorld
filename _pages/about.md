# Kai Lewis
## kailewis104@gmail.com
I am a highly motivated senior research associate at a leading crown research institute, specialising in digital horticulture. My background in microbiology and statistics, coupled with an enthusiasm for programming and electronics, has propelled my interest in data science. Overall I am a detail-oriented individual with exceptional interpersonal skills, poised to leverage my experience and education towards launching a successful career in data science.

## Key skills
* Data cleaning, manipulation and visualisation
* Statistical modelling 
* ETL pipelines (Apache Airflow, targets package in R, Orange, PowerAutomate)
* Programming (e.g. R, Python, SQL, CR Basic, Linux)
* Data visualisation tools (PowerBI, Grafana, Shiny)
* Presentation and report writing skills
* Experimental research and critical thinking

## Career History
**Senior Research Associate** at Plant and Food Research   
*July 2020 - present*   
My role is to provide technical support for field-based digital horticulture research programmes on a variety of crops (e.g. kiwifruit, grapevine, avocado).

### **Key responsibilities**
* Design and automate data visualisation reports using a combination of R (R markdown and Shiny), Python (Matplotlib and Seaborn), Grafana and PowerBI.
* Develop ETL pipelines in Python, R (target package), Apache Airflow and Orange for plant pathological research
* Provide programming, remote sensing and data analytics assistance in horticultural research (e.g. image pre-processing, statistical analysis).
* Preparation of client reports, conference presentations and peer-reviewed scientific publications.
* Manage several projects, including overseeing the set-up and maintenance of over 30 weather stations nation-wide. 

### **Achievements**
* Generated several epidemiological disease risk models, incorporating numerous statistical methods (e.g. Multiple regression, Logistic regression, Random forest, Support Vector Machines etc) 
* Designed and built Raspberry Pi device for embedding metadata within images for computer vision projects, along with an android app (Android studio and Kotlin).
* End-to-end data orchestration and analysis of remote sensing data (e.g. LiDAR scanning, hyperspectral imaging and environmental monitoring)

**Research Associate** at Plant and Food Research   
*April 2018 - July 2020*
